# Contrast Library

## Objective
Contrast Library is a solution for lending and borrowing for a community. We live in an age of consumerism and individualism. This web solution would counter this culture to encourage sharing and reduce buying.

## How It Works
Users can provide anything and everything that they would like to share with their community. This could be books, media, tools, lawn care, toys, games, etc. Other members can search for items they would like to borrow, or browse what is available. They would be able to contact the owner to discuss borrowing the item.
